# TODO

* support background images
* cross browser check?

* pass options to retrofy plugin:
  - color pallete (string to choose for built-in, obj for custom pallete)
  - blockSize

* rewrite bookmarkloader in coffeescript and send pull request for callback

chrome plugin version? (bookmarklet suffers from x-domain restrictions)

* Konami code version

improvements
* get median color?
* maybe process stylesheets instead of html elements? (now all elements get a style attr)
