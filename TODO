# TODO

- prevent pollution of global namespace
- fix images that are scaled with a width or height attribute
- support colors with an alpha channel
- gradients?
- chrome plugin version? (bookmarklet suffers from x-domain restrictions)

it should drop:
- border radius (because square is more retro! :D)

- pass options to retrofy plugin:
  - color pallete (string to choose for built-in, obj for custom pallete)
  - blockSize

- rewrite bookmarkloader in coffeescript and send pull request for callback

- Konami code version

improvements
- get median color?
